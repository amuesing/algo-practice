//**** Problem Solving Patterns ****//

How do you improve?
1) Devise a plan for solving the problem
2) Master common problem solving patterns

Some Patterns:
-Frequency Counter
-Multiple Pointers
-Sliding Window
-Divide and Conquer
-Dynamic Programming
-Greedy Algorithms
-Backtracking

Frequency Counters:

This pattern uses objects or sets to collect values/frequencies of values.

This can often avoid the need for nested loops or O(N^2) operations with arrays/strings.
