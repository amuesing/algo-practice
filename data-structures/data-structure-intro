Data Structures:

Binary Search Trees
Queues
Singly Linked List
Undirected Unweighted Graphs
Binary Heaps
Directed Graphs
Hash Tables
Doubly Linked Lists
Stacks

What do they do?

Data structures are collections of values, the relationships among them,
and the functions or operations that can be applied to the data.

Why so many???

Different data structures excel at different things.
Some are highly specialized, while others (like arrays)
are more generally used.

Why care??

The more time you spend as a developer,
the more likely you'll need to use one
of these data structures.

You've already worked with many of them unknowingly. (DOM is a Tree for instance).

And of course... INTERVIEWS

Working with Map/Location data -- use a graph

Need an ordered list with fast inserts/removals at the beginning and end? -- use linked list

Web scraping nested HTML -- use a tree

Need to write a scheduler -- use a heap
